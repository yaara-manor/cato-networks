# Getting Started with the macOS Client

## Overview

The Cato Client is proprietary endpoint software that delivers secure access, advanced security enforcement, and monitoring capabilities. Downloading, installing, and connecting the Client is a simple process that enables you to quickly begin using its features and realizing value.

Depending on how your organization has configured the remote access policies and Client settings, the behavior and available features may vary. Some options described in this article might not apply to your specific installation.

### Why Use the Cato Client?

The Client runs in the background on the device and contains a suite of features to secure your network, devices and identify and support your users.

The capabilities of the Client can be grouped into six key capabilities:

1. Identification and Authentication
2. Device Posture
3. Secured Remote Access (requires a ZTNA license)
4. Secured Internet Access (requires a ZTNA license)
5. Digital Experience (requires a DEM license)
6. User Engagement

For more information, see [Understanding the Capabilities of the Cato Client](/v1/docs/understanding-the-capabilities-of-the-cato-client).

### Prerequisites

- System level notifications must be enabled on the device to authenticate using the browser within the Client ([Embedded browser)](/v1/docs/configuring-the-authentication-policy-for-cato-clients).
- The Client is Allowed in the background (This is enabled in **Settings > General > Login Items**)
- The Client requires Full Disk Access permissions for Device Posture checks and collecting logs.
- Review the Prerequisites (especially the minimum device operating system) listed in [Preparing to Install the Cato Client](/v1/docs/preparing-to-install-the-cato-client).

- From the **Home** page of the Client, click the **Connect** button in the middle of the shield.

The Client connects to the network.

> [!NOTE]
> Note:
> 
> This is the only supported method of connecting to the network. Connecting from **System Preferences > Network** on the device is not supported.

## Connecting to a Specific PoP

By default, the Client automatically connects to the optimal PoP based on geolocation and connectivity metrics. For more information on the Client connection process, see [Preparing to Install the Cato Client](/v1/docs/preparing-to-install-the-cato-client).

You can override this process by manually entering the IP address of a specific PoP you want the Client to connect to. To view the IP addresses of Cato's PoPs, see [Production PoP Guide](/v1/docs/production-pop-guide).

![Manual_macOS.png](https://cdn.document360.io/81d0367c-2b69-4ba8-b412-1c8f46ce677e/Images/Documentation/33890766532253(1).png)

**To select the PoP the Client connects to:**

1. From the navigation menu in the Client, click **Users**.
2. Enable **PoP Server IP**.
3. Enter the IP address of the PoP you want the Client to connect to.

The Client connects to the manually selected PoP.

## Understanding Connectivity Statuses

You can view the Client connectivity status in the Client or using the tray icon. The symbols for each connectivity status are:

| Symbol | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ![Connected_macos.png](https://cdn.document360.io/81d0367c-2b69-4ba8-b412-1c8f46ce677e/Images/Documentation/33890756689181(1).png) | The Client is connected. |
| ![](https://cdn.document360.io/81d0367c-2b69-4ba8-b412-1c8f46ce677e/Images/Documentation/Warningmacos1.png) | The Client is connected but has a warning. |
| ![errormacos.png](https://cdn.document360.io/81d0367c-2b69-4ba8-b412-1c8f46ce677e/Images/Documentation/33890755642013(1).png) | The Client is connected but has an error (secure private access is unavailable while secure Internet is available). |
| ![](https://cdn.document360.io/81d0367c-2b69-4ba8-b412-1c8f46ce677e/Images/Documentation/Disconnected.png) | The Client is disconnected. |

## Understanding Authentication Errors

Based on the configuration of the [Client Connectivity policy](/v1/docs/what-is-the-client-connectivity-policy) the Client checks your device has the required software or updates installed before it allows you to connect to the network. For example, the Client checks if you have an up-to-date antivirus software installed. Only secure and compliant devices are allowed to connect. If the device doesn't comply with the Client Connectivity policy, the Client is blocked, and there is a notification with more details.

### How Do I Know if a Device Isn't Compliant?

If your device doesn’t meet the security policy, the Client doesn't connect and shows a message explaining the issue. Common reasons include:

- Out-of-date antivirus software version
- An unsupported operating system
- Need to update the Client to a newer version

Click **Details** in the message to see what failed.
