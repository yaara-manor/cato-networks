# How to Reset an X1500 Socket (USB Drive)

This article explains how to reset an X1500 Socket to the factory image using a USB drive.

> [!NOTE]
> WARNING!
> 
> Cato has multiple certified Socket hardware models for X1500 sites. Identify your exact Socket model before installing the image.

For more information about various X1500 Socket models, see [Reimaging Cato Sockets](/v1/docs/reimaging-cato-sockets).

## Identifying the X1500 Socket Model

There are separate images for the X1500, X1500B, and X1500C Socket models. Make sure that the PSU for the back panel of your Socket matches the picture below.

If the PSU for your Socket is different than the picture, see [How to Reset an X1500B Socket (USB Drive)](/v1/docs/how-to-reset-an-x1500b-socket-usb-drive) or [How to Reset an X1500C Socket (USB Drive)](/v1/docs/clone-how-to-reset-an-x1500b-socket-usb-drive). If you install the wrong image on a Socket, you can cause the Socket to stop working.

## Resetting the Socket to the Factory Default Configuration and Version

This is a high-level overview of the steps to reset a Socket to the factory image using a USB drive.

1. Prepare the image - download and untar it.
2. Burn the image to the USB drive.
3. Install the image on the Socket.

### Preparing the Socket Image

1. Download the image file from [here](/v1/docs/socket-and-vsocket-image-files).
2. Untar the image (see instructions below).

After you untar the image, the file is located in the following directory: `live`
3. Get a USB drive with at least 8GB. If you need to format the USB drive, use either exFAT or FAT32. If you use FAT32, the USB drive must be 32 GB or smaller.

### Burning the Image to the USB Drive

This section explains how to burn the Socket image to the USB drive for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

After you untar the image, compare the file hash of the uncompressed DD image file to the Cato verified, correct file hash. This confirms the disk image integrity before writing the Socket firmware to the hard drive.

- A file with the verified hash is attached to this article
- Save the file to the same directory as the uncompressed disk image

#### Burning the Image with Windows

1. Connect the USB drive to your Windows device.
2. Move both downloaded files to the same directory, for example `c:\Cato`
3. Untar the image. From an elevated PowerShell prompt in the same directory as both files, run `tar -xf &lt;archive-filename&gt;`

![x1500_untar_image.png](https://cdn.document360.io/81d0367c-2b69-4ba8-b412-1c8f46ce677e/Images/Documentation/28559075643165.png)

> [!TIP]
> **Important:**
> 
> Common decompression software (such as WinZip, 7-Zip, or WinRAR) will corrupt the image, resulting in a ~135 MB file. Extracting the file with the Windows CLI tar command should produce a file larger than 1GB.
4. Make sure to place the hash file in the same directory as the image file.
5. Run the following command to compare the file hash of the Socket image:

```powershell
(Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\IMAGE_INSTALL_socket_X1500_BR2_18960_production_socket_v21.1_20240919_2024_12_12.dd).Hash -eq (gc .\X1500-hash.txt).split()[0]
```

The command returns **True** when the hashes are the same.
6. Download and install disk imager software, such as Win32 Disk Imager.
7. Write the image to the USB drive. (You may need to show all the files with *.* to see the DD file)

#### Burning the Image with macOS

1. Connect the USB drive.
2. Open a terminal window.
3. Identify the new drive using the command `diskutil list`
4. Unmount the identified drive using `diskutil unmountDisk &lt;diskN&gt;`

<diskN> is a variable which you identify in the previous step, this sample output shows the drive as `disk0`:

```bash
diskutil list
/dev/disk0 (internal, physical)
```
5. Untar the image (double-click the file).
6. Run the following command to compare the file hash of the Socket image:

```bash
shasum -a 256 <archive-filename>
```

Compare the output of this command with the hash attached to this article.
7. Run the following command: `dd if=./&lt;file name&gt; of=/dev/diskN bs=16m`

For example `dd if=./IMAGE_INSTALL_socket_X1500_BR2_18960_production_socket_v21.1_20240919_2024_12_12.dd of=/dev/diskN bs=16m`

**WARNING:** Make sure you write the image on the USB drive and not on your hard disk.

#### Burning the Image with Linux

1. Connect the USB drive to your Linux machine
2. Identify which device is your USB `/dev/sdb` or `/dev/sdc`
3. Untar the image.
4. Run the following command to view the hash of the image file:

```bash
shasum -a 256 /<path to file>/<image filename>
```
5. Compare the output of the command to the hash attached to this article.
6. Run the following command to write the image to the USB:

```bash
dd if=./IMAGE_INSTALL_socket_X1500_BR2_18960_production_socket_v21.1_20240919_2024_12_12.dd of=/dev/sdX
```

**Notes:**
  - For supported versions, you can append `status=progress` to the `dd` command to see the status of the write-to-USB operation.
  - Make sure you write the image on the USB drive and not on your hard disk.

### Installing the Image on the Socket

After the Socket image is prepared on the USB drive, insert the drive in the Socket. When the Socket boots up, it installs the image and resets to factory default settings.

> [!NOTE]
> Note:
> 
> If the Socket is currently shown in the Cato Management Application as assigned to a site, unassign the Socket from the site (see [Managing Sockets](/v1/docs/managing-sockets)). Then after the new image is installed, you can assign the Socket to the site again.

1. Connect the USB drive to the Socket's USB port.
2. Reboot the Socket (unplug the power and plug it in again).
3. It takes up to 5 minutes to write the image to the Socket. When completed, the Socket will turn itself off.
4. **IMPORTANT!** Disconnect the USB drive (otherwise, step 3 will happen again).
5. Power up the Socket (unplug the power and plug it in again).
6. The Socket will start up on the default version and the factory default configuration.

### Verifying the Socket Version

After installing the Socket image, you can verify that the process has been successful by using the Socket WebUI to verify the Socket version.

For more about logging in to the Socket WebUI, see [Accessing the Socket WebUI](/v1/docs/accessing-the-socket-webui).

**Note:** If you log in to the Socket WebUI locally after installing the Socket image, the username and password are reset to their default values.

**To verify the Socket version locally:**

1. Log in to the Socket WebUI.

You can use an Ethernet cable to connect the MGMT port on the Socket to the computer.
2. Navigate to the **About** page.
3. Confirm that the **Version** is the same as the image file you downloaded above.

The example below shows the version for an X1500 Socket with Socket version 17.x:
