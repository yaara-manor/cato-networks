# License and Apps for Cato Third-Party Integrations

> **Deprecated.** **This article is deprecated and will be removed.**  To learn about the many services that integrate with Cato, see the [Cato Integration Hub](https://www.catonetworks.com/integrations/).

This article lists the different [third-party integrations](/v1/docs/using-the-integrations-page) that you can connect to your Cato account and which license is required for the integration. Some integrations are included with the default account license.

**Included** means that the integration type is part of the default Cato account and doesn't require an additional license.

> [!NOTE]
> Note:
> 
> Cato account licenses use one of two models: [Bursting Model](/v1/docs/jan-2027-license-bursting-model) (starting in January 2027) and Enforcement Model. The licenses listed in this table refer to both license models unless stated. Not sure which license your account uses? See [Identifying your License Model](/v1/docs/identifying-your-license-model).
