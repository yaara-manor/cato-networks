# Salesforce: Configuring the SaaS Posture Integration

## Overview

SaaS Posture integrations provide visibility into the configuration and security posture of your connected SaaS applications. Cato continuously reviews the application settings and compares them to the recommended posture defined by Cato’s research team. This helps identify misconfigurations that can increase risk, such as authentication settings, third-party integrations, and data-sharing controls.

Posture data appears in the Applications dashboard, where you can view posture scores and the highest-severity findings across connected applications. You can review each posture check from the Posture page, including the issue details, status, and remediation action required to pass the check.

For more information, see [Reviewing the Security Posture of Your SaaS Applications.](https://knowledge.catonetworks.com/v1/docs/understanding-the-security-posture-of-your-saas-applications)

To configure the SaaS Posture integration, you need to:

1. Configure the required settings in the SaaS application
2. Create the API connector in the CMA

A CASB license is required for SaaS Posture integrations.
