## Known Limitations for iOS Clients v5.0

This section lists known limitations that apply to all iOS Clients version 5.0 and higher.

- When a phone enters sleep mode, the Cato Client may disconnect from the VPN after a few minutes of inactivity. This behavior affects background connectivity and may interrupt services that rely on persistent VPN access.
  - This can impact apps, such as if the phone receives an incoming Microsoft Teams call while the phone is in sleep mode and the Cato Client is disconnected. The Teams call may disconnect when the Client automatically reconnects to the network.
- For accounts that use Device Authentication with a certificate, when the iOS device recovers from sleep mode, you need to open the Client (doesn't include Always On)
