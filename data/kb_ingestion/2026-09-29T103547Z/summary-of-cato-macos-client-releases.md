- **Record Client Issues**: An additional troubleshooting tool that lets users [record](/v1/docs/recording-issues-using-the-cato-client) and then reproduce an issue that occurred with the Client. The traffic capture and log files can be uploaded to Support for further analysis.
  - This feature and the existing ability to send logs to Support are available on the new Support tab in the Client

## macOS Client v5.7

From July 14, 2024, we are starting the rollout of macOS Client version 5.7. This version contains:

- **IPv6 Support for Last Mile Connection:** Users can connect remotely over ISPs that provide last-mile [IPv6-only](/v1/docs/cato-client-last-mile-support-for-ipv6) connections. Both IPv6 and IPv4 connections are now supported.
- **User Notifications for CASB and DLP:** The device displays a notification to the user when their activity is blocked by [App Control](/v1/docs/managing-the-application-control-policy) or [Data Control](/v1/docs/creating-the-data-control-policy) rules. This educates the user about which app was blocked and why.
- **End User Feedback:** To help us continually improve our remote access, users can now provide [feedback](/v1/docs/providing-cato-with-remote-user-feedback) to Cato from within the Client.
  - Every few months, users are prompted to give a rating and comments
  - Users can also manually provide feedback at any time
- **End of Support for Big Sur:** Devices running Big Sur (macOS 11) are no longer supported by the macOS Client
- **New Cato Root Certificate:** We added a new root certificate that is automatically installed on the device with the Cato Client.
  - The new certificate is called **Cato Networks Root CA** and expires in March 2034.
  - The previous certificate is from 2015 and is called **Cato Networks CA**. It will expire in Oct 2025.
- **Bug fix:**
  - If a login attempt failed, in some cases users were unable to connect to the network

## macOS Client v5.6

- **Updated Client Tray Icon**: We improved how the Client’s tray icon indicates a connected or disconnected status
- **New Indication of System Notification Status**: On the Settings page, we added the status of System Notifications and improved the messaging to highlight their importance
- Bug fixes and stability improvements

## Known Limitations for macOS Client 5.7

This section lists known limitations that apply to all the macOS Client version 5.7:

As a result of these limitations, we do not recommend installing macOS Sequoia (version 15) on devices running Client version 5.7 and lower.

- On macOS Sequoia (version 15), on the **Settings** page of the Client, if you click **Download logs**, the logs are not downloaded
- On macOS Sequoia (version 15), after connecting and minimizing the Client, it cannot be opened

## Known Limitations for macOS Client v5.5

This section lists known limitations that apply to all the macOS Clients version 5.5 and higher.

- On devices running macOS Sonoma (v14), start minimized is not supported. If Always-On is enabled the Client opens after the device boots.

## Known Limitations for macOS Client 5.4

This section lists known limitations that apply to all the macOS Clients version 5. and higher.

- If you downgrade the Client to v5.3, it may become unresponsive. To resolve this issue, restart the Client from the Application folder or Launchpad.
- If you downgrade the Client to v5.3, users other than the last connected user are removed
- With Always-On enabled, after a device wakes up or connects to a network, if Zoom is installed on the device, the Zoom app may open a pop up with a connection error. To resolve this issue, restart Zoom.
- If you manually install the VPN Profile and have Device Certificate checks included in the Device Posture Profile, a pop up is displayed requesting the keychain password.
- If you upgrade the Client with an MDM, pop ups are sometimes displayed requesting permission to allow the installation of system extensions and the VPN configuration.

To prevent this issue, you can first distribute the permissions for DMG extension and the VPN payload, then distribute the Clients to the macOS hosts.
- Connecting to Cato is only supported from within the Client. Connecting from **System Preferences > Network** (or from macOS Ventura **System Settings > VPN**) on the device is not supported.

## Known Limitations for macOS Client v5.3

This section lists known limitations that apply to all the macOS Clients version 5.3 and higher.

- After a device wakes up from sleep, the Client may accidentally show a message that the upgrade failed. No action is required, a few minutes after closing the message the Client automatically attempts to upgrade again.
- SDP users cannot disable office mode.

## Known Limitations for macOS Client v5.0 and Higher

This section lists known limitations that apply to all macOS Clients version 5.0 and higher.

- On devices running macOS 27 Golden Gate, some Device Posture checks fail
- When a macOS device enters sleep mode, the Cato Client may disconnect from the VPN after a few minutes of inactivity. This behavior affects background connectivity and may interrupt services that rely on persistent VPN access.
  - This can impact apps, such as if the macOS device receives an incoming Microsoft Teams call while the device is in sleep mode and the Cato Client is disconnected. The Teams call may disconnect when the Client automatically reconnects to the network.
- This Client version uses the 85.255.31.1 IP address as part of the infrastructure to support Single Sign-On (SSO)
  - Make sure that this IP address is NOT blocked by any third-party anti-malware software
- For accounts that use Azure Conditional Access, please set the **Browser Authentication** to **External Browser** (Access > Client Access > Authentication) For more information about Browser Authentication, see [Configuring the Authentication Policy for Cato Clients](/v1/docs/configuring-the-authentication-policy-for-cato-clients)
- For macOS devices with the Symantec Web Security Service (WSS) agent installed, we do not currently support installing the WSS agent and the macOS Client on the same device
- Uploading a local split-tunnel file to the Client is not supported. You can use the global split-tunnel settings in the Cato Management Application
- For OneLogin SSO, we recommend that you use the internal in-Client browser. When Browser Authentication is set to External Browser, if the browser window or tab is closed, the end-user can't authenticate to OneLogin
- In some cases, this version might experience problems with these configurations:
  - Azure Conditional Access
  - Proxy configuration
  - For accounts that use a third-party proxy, make sure to whitelist the following items (for both HTTP and HTTPS):
    - IP address - 85.255.31.1
    - URL - sso.ias.catonetworks.com
