## Known Limitations for Windows Client v5.2 and Higher

This section lists known limitations that apply to all the Windows Clients version 5.2 and higher.

- For deployments with a third-party proxy, Internet Explorer is not supported as the default browser.
  - Configure a different default browser on the device.

## Known Limitations for Windows Client v5.0 and Higher

This section lists known limitations that apply to all the Windows Clients version 5.0 and higher.

- This Client version uses the 85.255.31.1 IP address as part of the infrastructure to support Single Sign-On (SSO)
  - Make sure that this IP address is NOT blocked by any third-party anti-malware software
- For accounts that use Azure Conditional Access, please set the **Browser Authentication** to **External Browser** (Access > Client Access > Authentication) For more information about Browser Authentication, see [Configuring the Authentication Policy for Cato Clients](/v1/docs/configuring-the-authentication-policy-for-cato-clients)
- Set **Browser Authentication** to internal **In-Client Browser** to authenticate to OneLogin
- For OneLogin SSO, we recommend that you use the internal in-Client browser. When Browser Authentication is set to External Browser, if the browser window or tab is closed, the end-user can't authenticate to OneLogin
- Windows 8.1 OS is only supported when all the newest Microsoft updates and patches are installed
- Automatic Upgrade for Windows Servers is currently not supported
- Automatic Upgrade for the Windows Client version 5.0 is disabled for hosts that use the Windows Server operating system and the Trusted Browsing feature on the Windows Server blocks the Client from authenticating
  - Solution: To use Windows Client v5.0 on a Windows Server you can use one of the following solutions and then install or upgrade the new Client version:
    - Allowlist the domains for your IdP for Trusted Browsing
    - Disable the Trusted Browsing feature
- In some cases, for Windows devices with the Intel Killer Wireless NICs, after the Client connects to the network all traffic is blocked
  - Workaround: Disable the Killer Network Service on the Windows device, and then use the Cato Client to connect to the network
- When using TAP virtual adapter, the MAC address of the Cato virtual adapter in the Client is randomly generated and isn’t guaranteed to be unique across the Clients in your network. Sometimes the MAC address isn’t shown for the virtual adapter.
  - When the MAC address is required, we recommend that you use the MAC address of the physical device instead of the Client virtual adapter.
- If you change the default installation folder, during a Client upgrade or if you delete the Client, other files within the directory are deleted. If you add items to the default installation folder (C:\Program Files\Cato Networks\) they are deleted during a Client upgrade or if you delete the Client.
- If IP routing is enabled on the device, the Client cannot authenticate.
  - Workaround: Disable IP routing on Windows. For more information, see [IP Routing Prevents Windows Client Authentication](/v1/docs/ip-routing-prevents-windows-client-authentication).
