# Synk: Configuring the SaaS Anomalies Connector

This article explains how to configure the SaaS Anomalies connector for Synk.

## Overview

The Snyk connector lets you monitor security alerts from your Snyk environment in Cato. This includes posture issues and vulnerabilities detected in your projects and infrastructure. By integrating Snyk with Cato, you gain centralized visibility into these alerts for easier monitoring and investigation. This helps you respond more quickly and maintain stronger security oversight across your environment.

To configure the SaaS Anomalies integration, you need to:

1. Configure the integration within the SaaS application
2. Create the API connector in the CMA
