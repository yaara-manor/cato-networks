# Understanding Event Fields (DEPRECATED)

> **Deprecated.** **This article is deprecated and will be removed.**  For up-to-date information about event fields, see [Cato Event Schema](https://knowledge.catonetworks.com/docs/cato-event-schema).

## Explaining the Available Fields

These are descriptions of event fields for the Cato Management Application (CMA). Event fields are frequently updated, for the full list of event fields, please refer to the Cato GraphQL API Reference for [EventFieldName](https://api.catonetworks.com/documentation/#definition-EventFieldName).

For customers that use the Cato API for event data, see [Cato API Potentially Breaking Changes and EoL](/v1/docs/cato-api-potentially-breaking-changes-and-eol) for notifications on potentially breaking changes and end-of-life (EoL) announcements for the Cato GraphQL API schema. We recommend that you follow the article to automatically receive email notifications for updates and changes.
