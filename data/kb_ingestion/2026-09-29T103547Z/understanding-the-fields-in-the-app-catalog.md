# Understanding the Fields in the App Catalog

## Overview

This article provides a reference for the fields that are available for applications in the [App Catalog](/v1/docs/using-the-app-catalog). Use this reference to understand the metadata that Cato shows for each application and how these fields can help you evaluate apps for your organization.

The App Catalog is continuously updated with new applications and metadata by Cato’s Security Research team, and this data is used across the CMA to help you evaluate apps and use them in policies and rulebases.
