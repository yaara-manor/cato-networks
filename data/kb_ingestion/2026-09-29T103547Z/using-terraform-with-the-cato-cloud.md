# Using Terraform with the Cato Cloud

## Overview

The [Cato Networks Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/namespaces/catonetworks) lets you manage your account with Infrastructure as Code (IaC)-based automation. You can declaratively configure and maintain resources such as Socket sites, IPsec sites, WAN firewall rules, routing policies, and identity integrations directly in Terraform.

- Integrate Cato’s global cloud network into CI/CD pipelines
- Enforce consistent network and security policies across environments
- Streamline provisioning of secure connectivity for cloud, data center, and branch locations

The provider supports both standalone usage and integration with Cato-certified Terraform modules for cloud deployments. For more information, see [https://registry.terraform.io/providers/catonetworks/cato/latest](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/catonetworks/cato/latest)

The Cato Terraform provider uses the API, which requires an [API key](/v1/docs/generating-api-keys-for-the-cato-api).

### Versioning

The Terraform provider follows a formal semantic versioning schema (`X.Y.Z`), so you can tell from any release number what it contains and control which updates your configuration accepts. Set version constraints in your provider block to allow updates within a major version while holding back major upgrades.

- Patch (`X.Y.Z`) and minor (`X.Y.0`) releases contain no breaking changes.
- Major releases (`X.0.0`) may require configuration or state migration
- Beta releases (`X.Y.Z-beta.N`) are excluded from automatic updates and must be pinned explicitly

## Available Modules

The Terraform provider implementation, modules, and examples are available in the corresponding repositories at: [https://github.com/catonetworks](https://github.com/catonetworks).
