# Using the Experience Monitoring Page

This article explains how to use the **Experience Monitoring** page to monitor performance and user experience in your network.

## Overview

Traffic and performance of applications can be related to factors outside of the Cato Cloud. The Cato DEM service provides insight into user, application, and site experience, proactively monitoring performance and pinpointing issues. From the **Experience Monitoring** page, you can view a summary of user experience for application usage in your network on the account or site level. You can further drill-down to see the experience for specific sites, applications, or remote and office workers. You can use the filters and widgets to help you see the data to troubleshoot the cause of poor app performance.

The **Experience Monitoring** page displays data from traffic that flows through the Cato Cloud. DEM only analyzes traffic data from sites or remote users via the Clients. For more information about Experience Monitoring, see [What is Cato Experience Monitoring](/v1/docs/what-is-cato-experience-monitoring).

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:**
> 
> Application performance metrics are only calculated for outbound TCP traffic.

### Getting Started with Experience Monitoring

The **Experience Monitoring** page displays the average experience score for all an account. You can further breakdown the score by site, remote and office users, users and hosts, and applications.

When clicking on any of the tabs on the page, you have a list of sites, users, or applications to get more information about the experience of those specific entities. For example, if a user is complaining about a poor experience, you can filter by that user's name or click on the **Remote User** tab to locate them. Once you click on their name, you can see more high-level information in the [Connection Details](/v1/docs/experience-monitoring-connection-details) nodes, and click on the different tabs to see if there is a problem on their computer, Wi-Fi connection, or one of the applications they're using.

**To view the Experience Monitoring page:**

- From the navigation menu, click **Home > Experience Monitoring**.

The following table explains the data and analytics available from the Experience Monitoring page.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Summary Bar | At the top of the page, the summary bar shows account-wide experience monitoring data, including: - Connectivity status of account sites - Summary of experience scores for WAN and Internet applications - Summary of app integrations statuses |
| Filter Bar | The filters are applied to the page. Selected filters apply to all widgets on the page. A filter for Sanctioned Applications is applied by default. |
| Time Range | The time range applied to the page. The maximum time range is three months. |
| Account Experience | The average experience score over time for all applications and the number of applications in each experience category (**Good**/**Fair**/**Poor**). The average experience score is based on these application performance metrics: - Time to First byte - TCP Connect - TLS Connect - HTTP Latency - HTTP/S error Cato's AI-based algorithm creates unique thresholds for every app. The graph shows average experience over time for sites, remote users, and the overall account (sites and remote users). |
| Feed | A dynamic feed of recent events related to experience issues. - For accounts with an XOps license, the feed shows recent XOps stories related to experience issues, such as [Experience Anomaly](/v1/docs/analyzing-experience-monitoring-anomalies) stories, [Account Operations](/v1/docs/drilling-down-and-analyzing-xops-account-operations-stories-1) stories, and more. |
| Experience Type Tabs | Each tab shows the analytics and data for that entity in your network: Sites, Remote Users, Office Users, Site Hosts, and Applications. Each tab displays data for the selected entity. You can click on items in this table to open the drill-down page for the entity. |

## Filtering the Experience Monitoring Page

There are two ways to filter the data in the Experience Monitoring page:

- Automatically update the filter with the selected item
- Manually configure the filter

When you manually create a filter or add an item to the update filter, the data and analytics on the Experience Monitoring page is automatically updated and only shows data for filtered items. For example, if you filter for the Microsoft Word application, the page only shows analytics and data that are related to using the Microsoft Word application. No other application data is displayed until you change or clear the filter.

The Experience Monitoring page data is typically up-to-date within a 5 minute time frame. However, it is possible that some data will be delayed up to 30 minutes.

For more about configuring filters, see [Configuring Filters to Analyze Dashboard Data](/v1/docs/configuring-filters-to-analyze-dashboard-data).

## Reviewing Analytics

You can review detailed analytics for each site, remote or office user, user/host, or application used in your network. This provides you with granular data to monitor the experience across your network.

A **User** is a user logged in to a device with the Cato Client installed on it and connecting as follows:

- Remote User - connecting remotely (not from behind a site)
- Office User - connecting from behind a site

A **Site host** is a device that is connecting to the network without the Client located behind a site, for example an IoT device or printer.

### Drilling Down to Review Specific Item Data

Select a tab and then a specific item to drill down and view data for that item in a different page.

**To drill down and review data for a specific item:**

1. Select one of the tabs.
2. Click on an item. A new page opens with data for the specific item.

### Understanding Site Experience Monitoring

The **Sites** tab shows a broad set of experience monitoring data for each site in the account. The **Performance View** dropdown lets you select from a range of tables showing metrics for different nodes in the network path. By default, the **Application** metrics described in the table below are shown. You can also view metrics for these nodes: **Socket**, **Last Mile - Underlay**, **Last Mile - Overlay**. For a description of these additional views, see below [Additional Site Experience Metric Tables](/docs/using-the-experience-monitoring-page#h_01KRXGRPCGDDBM8Q1GTDQT61FP).

When you drill down into a site, the page provides information about the site, such as its current connection and HA status, the PoP it's connected to, and how many hosts are currently connected through the site.

In addition, the Connection Details widget shows nodes in a site to help you pin-point the issue impacting the user experience. This widget provides an instant understanding of how the different nodes in the site are functioning, and gives you a visual indication if there is a problem anywhere in the connection. For example, if the Last Mile node is yellow, you can click to see the widgets for the Last Mile connection to see if there are any issues.

For a full list of the available widgets, see [The Site Experience Monitoring Drill-Down Page](/v1/docs/the-site-experience-monitoring-drill-down-page).

By default, the **Application** metrics described in the table below are shown. You can also view metrics for these nodes: **Device**, **Wi-Fi**, **LAN Gateway**, and **Last Mile - Overlay**. For a description of these additional views, see below [Additional Remote and Office User Experience Metric Tables](/docs/using-the-experience-monitoring-page#h_01KRXGRPCGP539ZZR7M2D39A43).

When you drill down into data for a specific user, the page provides information such as the site the user is connected through, their device name, OS, and internal and external IP addresses.

In addition, the Connection Details can provide you with an instant understanding of how the different nodes in the user's connection experience are functioning, and give you a visual indication if there is a problem anywhere in the connection. For example, if the Device node is yellow, you can click to see the widgets for the Device to see if there are issues with the CPU or memory.

The different tabs on the User Experience page provide more information about the connection through the various widgets.
